# fp-ts Tutorial

[fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) is a TypeScript library that provides common patterns and abstractions from other functional languages.

This repository contains examples from the [fp-ts tutorial series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMXrUa_EuePN94nJ2hAui5nWDj8RO3lH).

## Usage

You should first install the dependencies by running `yarn`.

Then, you can run `yarn start`, which runs `index.ts` with `ts-node-dev` in watch mode.

Inside `index.ts`, you can import the file from the chapter that you want, and then add logs and play around with the code.

Alternatively, you can run these files with a node debugger to see what happens line by line.

## Chapters

Here's the list of chapters for your convenience:

- [Chapter 1: pipe and flow](./chapter-1.0/)
- [Chapter 2: Option](./chapter-2.0/)
- [Chapter 2.1: Option map, flatten, chain](./chapter-2.1/)
- [Chapter 2.2: Option fromPredicate](./chapter-2.2/)
- [Chapter 2.3: Option error handling](./chapter-2.3/)
- [Chapter 3: Either](./chapter-3.0/)
